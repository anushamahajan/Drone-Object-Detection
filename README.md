# Drone-Object-Detection
In this project, the main function is to detect and identify objects in real-time using the the Drone Camera, which has been substituted by my laptop camera for real-time outputs.
The codebase utilizes OpenCV and Python, to perform image processing and object recognition . 
The function allows users to visualize and analyze detected objects in the laptop's live feed, showcasing the project's potential for various real-world applications.

**The live outputs are shown below:**
